        * Contained by books ⊂ 👉 [three e-books](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp)

## Description
* Three e-books written in my freshman year
    * have freely explored mathematics (geometry & algebra), physics, and programming
    * generated through Word_2_Pdf :sweat_smile:...
    * the 2nd book『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』contains C++ codes.

* 『Book 2』's『Partitions: 1+6= 2+5= ...= 7』related『Sections』

* 『Book 1』's『Multinomial theorem』related『Sections』

## Inplementation
1. Open the folder "cpp_codes_for_book2『Illusions_of_Illustrations_·_Zodiac』".
2. Open any of the 12 programs inside using Visual C++ 6.0, to be more precise, 
    * using `Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0\Common\MSDev98\Bin\MSDEV.EXE`.
    * [VC6.0 Download & Setup](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6YNbpj6RlCNh9zZd5K1wQA) ; Higher version of C++ is recommended, but may not be able to run this project?

## History
* These 👉 [three e-books](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/3_books_with_cpp) were written
    * (Personal time) by 18~19-year-old little Xie
        * 18-year-&-6-month-old to 19-year-&-4-month-old 
    * (Personal stage) in grades 1-2 of undergraduate studies
        * First year of undergraduate (Enrollment until the start of sophomore year)
    * (World time) approximately during 2016-2017
        * 2016.10 - 2016.12 - 2017.08
